### Wiring
Make an account with your Google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

### Reflection
What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience?  Your ultimate goal for the reflection is to pass on the knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person.

## How To Fix the LCD power issue with Metro M4 boards.

### Description & Code

* **The symptoms:**  LCD acting weird OR trouble with usb connection / serial monitor / uploading / etc.
* **The problem :** The LCDs occasionally draw too much power when we turn on the boards, and that makes parts of its serial communications crash.
* **The Solution:** Add this code, and wire a switch up, like the wiring diagram below:



```python
import board
import time
import digitalio
from lcd.lcd import LCD
from lcd.i2c_pcf8574_interface import I2CPCF8574Interface

# turn on lcd power switch pin
lcdPower = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D8)
lcdPower.direction = digitalio.Direction.INPUT
lcdPower.pull = digitalio.Pull.DOWN

# Keep the I2C protocol from running until the LCD has been turned on
# You need to flip the switch on the breadboard to do this.
while lcdPower.value is False:
    print("still sleeping")
    time.sleep(0.1)

# Time to start up the LCD!
time.sleep(1)
print(lcdPower.value)
print("running")

i2c = board.I2C()
lcd = LCD(I2CPCF8574Interface(i2c, 0x27), num_rows=2, num_cols=16)


# Loop forever.
while True:

```

### Reflection# CPyProjectTemplate
Put a description for your project here!
This repo is a template VS code project for CircuitPython projects that automatically uploads your code to the board when you press F5. Requires F5Anything extension.
## What does this do?
This makes it easirt to develop for boards like 
## Use
### Every new project:
1. Make a GitHub account if you don't have one with your normal school credentials and sign into it.
2. Click the big green Use This Template button at the top of this page.
3. Name the new repository something appropriate to the purpose of your project (Your first one should probably be named `Engr3`).
4. Hit "Create repository from template." (The default settings should be fine.)
5. Open VS Code on your machine. Click Clone Repository. If it doesn't show up, hit Ctrl+Shift+P and then type Clone, then hit Enter.
6. Paste in the link to the new repository you've just created from the template and hit enter.
7. For the location, Documents folder.
8. Hit "Open Cloned Directory" in the bottom-left corner.
9. Install the reccomended extensions when you get that popup in the lower right corner. IF the pop-up dissapears before you can click it, hit the tiny bell icon in the lower left corner to bring it back.
### To commit from VS Code:
1. Go to the little branch icon in the left bar of VS Code.
2. Click the + icon next to the files you want to commit.
3. Write a message that descibes your changes in the "Message" box and hit commit.
4. If you get an error about user.name and user.email, see the next section.
5. Click the "Sync changes" button.
### If you get an error about user.name and user.email
1. In VS Code, hit `` Ctrl+Shift+` ``
2. Filling in your actual information, run the following commands one line at a time. The paste shortcut is `Ctrl+V` or you can right click then hit paste. Spelling must match exactly:
```
git config --global user.name YOURGITHUBUSERNAME
git config --global user.email YOURSCHOOLEMAIL
```
3. Return to the previous section.
### To install a library:
1. Get the library files from the Adafruit bundle (probably a .mpy file or a folder.)
2. Copy them to the lib folder *in your project's folder, usually in Documents.* **Don't copy to the lib folder on the board! It will not work!**
3. Hit F5 and the library will be uplaoded to the board.
